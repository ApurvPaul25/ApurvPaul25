🌱 Currently learning:
Better React patterns, performance tweaks, and modern CSS tricks

👯 Looking to collaborate on:
Frontend apps, dashboards, landing pages, or anything UI-heavy

🤔 Looking for help with:
Open-source contributions and building frontend systems that scale

⚡ Fun fact:
I’ll spend 30 minutes fixing a 2px misalignment and call it a win.
